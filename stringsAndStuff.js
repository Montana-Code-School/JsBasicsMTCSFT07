//Here's three words = moose, Christmas, a

//here's a function called countLetters

var countLetters = function(word){
  
  //write code inside these brackets that counts the number of letters in the word to make
  //the code below work
}


countLetters("moose");
// 5
countLetters("Christmas");
// 9
countLetters("a");
//1

//verify that it works using console logs. If that doesn't make sense, try to figure it out!

//Finally, add a console log in countLetters() that logs "We got a capital letter in this word, better get out the pitchforks
because I hate capital letters and Mark is a moron who thinks he can get away with putting capital letters in words that my 
function has to deal with"
